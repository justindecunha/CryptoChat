# CryptoChat

​	CryptoChat is a simple, serverless LAN chat application. It was designed to showcase decenteralized multicast group communication, in which each individual client communicates with the group itself, rather than a centeral server.

## Features

​	CryptoChat was designed with simplicity in mind. Simply load the application, and start chatting with anyone else who had the app loaded on the same LAN network as you. A display name and password can optionally be specified in the settings screen. 

##### Display Name

​	If a display name is not selected, recipients will see your username displayed as your current LAN IP address. When the user specifies a display name, this will get sent along with each message the user sends, and will be viewed in the chat by the recievers.

##### Password

​	If a password is not selected, messages will be broadcast to the group in plain text. If a password is opted for, recipients of your messages must also have set the same password as you in order to read your messages. Anyone who recieves your messages who doesn't have the same password as you will only be able to see your unreadable encrypted message
